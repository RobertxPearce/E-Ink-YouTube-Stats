# E-Ink-YouTube-Stats
This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to set up a Raspberry Pi Zero W with a Waveshare Three Color 2.13-inch E-ink Display HAT to display YouTube channel statistics including subscriber count, view count, and video count. The project fetches the statistics using the YouTube Data API and updates the display at regular intervals.
